Titanic Data - Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The description of this dataset is on the Kaggle website, where the data was obtained.
The original data is in CVS format. I use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to clean and analyze the data and shared my findings in Jupyter Notebook. The main area I investigated is what factors made people more likely to survive.
